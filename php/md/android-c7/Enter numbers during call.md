**Sometimes you'll need to enter extra numbers after making a call.**  
This happens when you're prompted by an automated voice system—like when using a prepaid calling card to call Hong Kong, or when contacting a government line that asks you to enter your card number.

**How to Enter Numbers During a Call:**  
Once your call connects and you hear the automated voice, you won’t be able to type numbers right away.

To make this easier, **turn on Speaker Mode**—this lets you hear the instructions clearly while keeping the phone in front of you, so you can see and use the keypad without holding the phone to your ear. Press the speaker icon (See highlighted in gray):

After that, there are numbers appearing on your screen. By tapping these numbers, you can enter the additional numbers when prompted by the automated system's computer voice.

Then it asks to press "1" to check your card's balance. You press 1. The phone's display shows a history of what buttons have been pressed:
