## Envisioning
From the vision, you create a Backlog and Product Roadmap.

### Product roadmap
It's a quick multi-lane table of different aspects of the product's existence - market, feature, tech architecture, release schedule

### Backlog

You can take from the roadmap and create the backlog

Those backlog items are a mix of features, bug fixes, technical improvements (may be user-experienced like improved performance, or may lead to better developer productivity like refactored code, or may eliminate technical debt that becomes disastrous later), and knowledge acquisition (Split A/B Testing)

### Organizing the backlog

Think of the backlog as stacks from top to bottom. The top stacks are the ones you're popping off first in your team. You will have multiple releases down the stack. So you have to consider what's important to users on Release 1, and the least important are stashed away at the bottom:

It will waste time to figure out sizing of much later events. Instead of breaking them down to concrete numbers, just estimate the much later events qualitatively as L, XL, etc. You might learn you were mistakened about your assumptions of the market demands and have to discard much of the later plans, so don't waste time planning too far into the future:

> Here's one way to broadly categorize L, XL, etc - by estimating costs

From gathering and writing stories, you can figure out what features are important and of higher priority to users. Place the least important at the bottom of the Backlog.

To further hone in the fact that user-valued features should be delivered in earlier releases:

### Keeping the backlog accurate over time (Grooming)

You should update the backlog as you learn more about the market over time, possibly at the end of each sprint. Here's an example of reprioritizing items on the backlog - aka Grooming. Keep in mind you should also restructure the sprints to fit the right man hours and team capacity:

Also note - you may have to scope the sprints differently to fit the times, budget, avoid burnout, etc. Will cover sprint planning later. 

### Keeping the product portfolio accurate over time

If your company has multiple products, you don't want to overwork your developers on simultaneous products to the point of producing lower quality work... and you don't want products/features that are irrelevant and sinking your budget. As you learn more about the market, you may have to sunset some features/products, and introduce others into your portfolio of products. These are called in-flow and out-flow of products to your portfolio. Make sure the in-flow and out-flow are balanced so you don't unreasonably add too much or take away too much.

### Planning in general

For when we first envision the product - Read page's paragraph:

#### Daily Scrum
Have daily SCRUM meetings to see what process is working, what features are taking longer than expected, and who needs help.

When a feature is very behind, you can have multiple people work on it to clear it off before resuming their own tasks. Daily meetings make this possible. Consider breadth vs depth:

#### Swarm and concurrent tasks

![](https://i.imgur.com/vueKofn.jpg)

Consider which employees have enough skills in other areas to swarm in and help the person who is behind on a task. Depth is their expertise that they return to focusing on after finished swarming.

The others who can't generalize and help will continue their concurrent tasks with the rest of the team.

#### End of each sprint

Have a meeting at the end of every sprint to review what process worked, and how the features are coming (any assumptions challenged)? Do we need to readjust the sprint and backlogs?

#### End of each release

Here we can have knowledge acquisition on whether our feature is indeed desired by the market, etc and we pivot as necessary.

### Planning sprints

Each sprint can be 1 week or 2 weeks. You can base on points.  Fit the times, budget, avoid burnout, etc

^ You are going to cluster the backlog product items BPI's into sprints. So you have Sprint backlogs. 

A sprint can be 1 week or 2 weeks, and you'r'e going to determine how many sprints before a release:

### Planning releases

You can communicate how much more needed to be done before release with a Burndown chart (expect with productivity that at a later time, the amount of work left will bring the line down to 0):

### Misc - The consequences of delay

You should also plan your backlog around what needs to be out sooner and what costs you can handle:

### Misc - In the economics of SCRUM

Here we see the importance of early releases and the fail fast approach so we can learn if our assumption about the market need is correct and we can pivot earlier rather than later. Give incremental funding so you don't drain the budget on an unneeded batch of requirements.
