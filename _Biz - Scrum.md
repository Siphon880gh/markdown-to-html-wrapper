## Envisioning
From the vision, you create a backlog and Product roadmap.
- Product Backlog
- Product Roadmap

### Product roadmap
It's a quick multilane table of different aspects of the product's existence - market, feature, tech architecture, release schedule

### Backlog

You can take from the roadmap and create the backlog

Those backlog items are a mix of features, bug fixes, technical improvements (may be user experienced like improved performance, or may lead to better developer productivity like refactored code, or may eliminate technical debt that becoems apparent later), and knowledge acquisition (Split A/B Testing)

### Organizing the backlog

Think of the backlog as stacks from top to bottom. The top stacks are the ones you're going to pop off first in your team. You will have multiple releases down teh stack. So you have to consider what's important to users on Release 1, and the least important are at the bottom of the stack:

It will be wasteful timing to figure out the sizing of much later events so you can just estimate and categorize by L, XL, etc, rather than concrete numbers. You may learn that your assumptions about what the market demands may be wrong and end up discarding much of the later work, so don't waste your time planning too far into the future:

> Here's one way to broadly  categorize L, XL, etc - by estimated costs

You can figure out what features are important and higher priority to users to place on the product backlog by gathering stories:

To further hone in the fact that valued features should be delivered in earlier releases:

### Keeping the backlog accurate over time (Grooming)

You may want to update the backlog as you learn more about the market over time, possibly at the end of each sprint. Here's an example of reprioritizing items on the backlog - aka Grooming. But keep in mind you may have to restructure the sprints to fit the right man hours and team capacity:

Keep in mind you may have to scope the sprints differently to fit the times, budget, avoid burnout, etc. Will cover sprint planning later. 

### Keeping the product portfolio accurate over time

If your company has multiple products, you don't want to thin out your developers working on the same products multiple times. You don't want products/features that are irrelevant sinking your budget. As you learn more about the market, you may have to sunset some features/products, and introduce others into your portfolio of products. Make sure the in-flow and out-flow are balanced so you don't unreasonably add too much or take away too much.

### Planning in general

When we first envision the product (read page's paragraph):

#### Daily Scrum
You have daily SCRUM meetings to see what process is working, what features are taking longer than expected, and who needs help.

When some feature is very behind, you can have multiple people work on it to clear it off before resuming their own tasks. Daily meetings make this possible. Consider breadth vs depth:

#### Swarm and concurrent tasks

![](https://i.imgur.com/vueKofn.jpg)

Consider which employees have enough skills in other areas to swarm in and help the person who is behind on a task. Depth is their expertise that they return to focusing on after finished swarming.

The others who can't generalize and help will continue their concurrent tasks with the rest of the team.

#### End of each sprint

Have a meeting end of each sprint to review what process worked, and how the features are coming (any assumptions challenged)? Do we need to readjust the sprint and backlogs?

#### End of each release

Here we can have knowledge acquisition on whether our feature is indeed desired by the market, etc and we pivot as necessary.

### Planning sprints

Each sprint can be 1 week or 2 weeks. You can base on points.  Fit the times, budget, avoid burnout, etc

You are going to cluster the backlog product items BPI's into sprints. A sprint can be 1 week or 2 weeks, and you'r'e going to determine how many sprints before a release:

### Planning releases

You can communicate how much more needed to be done before release with a Burndown chart (expect with productivity that at a later time, the amount of work left will bring the line down to 0):

### Misc - The consequences of delay

You should also plan your backlog around what needs to be out sooner and what costs you can handle:

### Misc - In the economics of SCRUM

The importance of early releases and the fail fast approach so we can learn if our assumption about the market need is correct and we can pivot earlier than later. You give incremental funding so you don't drain the budget on an unneeded batch of requirements.
